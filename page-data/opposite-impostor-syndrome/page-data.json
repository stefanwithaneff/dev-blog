The opposite of Impostor Syndrome is boredom.</p>\n<p>I’ve dealt with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\">Impostor Syndrome</a> a lot in my career as a web developer. It was a primary motivator for dropping out of my college CS program, and the feeling of being a fraud hounded me through my first few years of professional development. Something changed when I moved to my most recent job, though.</p>\n<p>Gone was the usual panicked feeling that came with moving to a new team. Instead, I felt <strong>boredom</strong>. There were new technologies to learn, new codebases and services to understand. These were the things that used to get me excited about my job. Now, they barely provided any nutritional value. I had been on enough teams, dealt with enough technical problems, that it didn’t really take any effort to understand these new things. I was competent. I was <em>experienced.</em></p>\n<h2>Applying Flow Theory</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\">Flow theory</a> is a model used to understand the mental state of a person engaging with a task. It explores the relationship between the challenge level of the task and the skill level of the person.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 382px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7e0060f8a0be52d62ea226504d28f455/77edc/flow-chart.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 64.86486486486486%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Chart explaining Flow theory\"\n        title=\"Chart explaining Flow theory\"\n        src=\"/static/7e0060f8a0be52d62ea226504d28f455/77edc/flow-chart.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7e0060f8a0be52d62ea226504d28f455/12f09/flow-chart.png 148w,\n/static/7e0060f8a0be52d62ea226504d28f455/e4a3f/flow-chart.png 295w,\n/static/7e0060f8a0be52d62ea226504d28f455/77edc/flow-chart.png 382w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>If challenge outpaces skill, then the person may feel worried, frustrated, or anxious. If skill outpaces challenge, it can lead to feelings of apathy. If challenge and skill remain in balance, the person will feel a sense of heightened engagement and fulfillment.</p>\n<p>I argue that Impostor Syndrome is an example of the kind of anxiety that can form when perceived challenge outweighs an individual’s skill level. If that is true, then the opposite of Impostor Syndrome is the result of skill outweighing challenge: boredom.</p>\n<p>Theoretically, the goal should be to maintain the balance between skill and challenge in one’s work, but that isn’t always feasible. There won’t always be opportunities to pursue more challenging work in the same job or on the same team or in the same company or even in the same field. As a developer, the goal is to find ways to deal with the boredom that comes with becoming more competent.</p>\n<h2>Dealing with Boredom</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Seek greater challenges</li>\n<li>Introduce variety to your work</li>\n<li>Try something completely different</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Opposite of Impostor Syndrome","date":"June 27, 2020","description":"Developers often discuss how to deal with Impostor Syndrome.
